  ## Project Objective
  To create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the Inquirer package.  This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.
  
  ## User Story
  AS A developer, I WANT a README generator with the title of my project, table of content, project description, installation instruction, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instruction, a list of license options and a badge for that license with the corresponding links if provided, SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.

  ## Technologies 
  ```
  node.js, npm inquirer, Javascript, Markdowns
  ```
  
  ## Installation
  Access to GitHub.com and a code editor such as vscode is necessary. Click the GitHub link provided above to the APP REPO. Click on the green button that says Clone or Download and Choose how you would like to download: using the SSH/HTTPS keys or download the zip file. If using SSH/HTTPS Key: You will copy the link shown and open up either terminal (mac: pre-installed) or gitbash (pc: must be installed). Once the application is open, you will type git clone paste url here. If using Download ZIP: Click on Download Zip. Locate the file and double click it to unzip the file. Locate the unzipped folder and open it. 

  ## Usage 
  In order to use this APP, you need terminal (mac: pre-installed) or gitbash (pc: must be installed). You also need to download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager. Open the cloned REPO in your favorite code editor, and then in terminal, enter the command “ npm i inquirer“ or “yarn add inquirer”  to install  the dependency [inquirer package](www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).  Now you are ready to start using  the app by entering “node index.js” on your terminal or gitbash.
